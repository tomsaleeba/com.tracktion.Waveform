Fork notes
---
Disclaimer: this is the first time I've worked on a flatpak package, so this might be
wrong ðŸ¤·.

This isn't published anywhere official yet, so you need to build it yourself. I did build
a "repo" dir and I've attached that as a tarball to a github release if that's useful.

Thanks to [alesya-h](https://github.com/alesya-h) for all the hard work on updating to
Waveform12.

The changes I made
- change package name to include `12`, so it's a separate app from v11, as suggested in
  [this comment](https://github.com/flathub/com.tracktion.Waveform/pull/7#issuecomment-1126780423)
- update to use the latest v12 available


## How to build
Building is basically following: https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/first-build.html

Make sure `flatpak-builder` is installed 
```
yay -S flatpak-builder
```

Install the platform SDK
```
# note: this matches the runtime, runtime-version and sdk tags in the yml file
flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Platform//21.08 org.freedesktop.Sdk//21.08
```

Clone this repo.


Init the submodule
```
git submodule update --init
```

Build the project
```
flatpak-builder build-dir com.tracktion.Waveform12.yml
```

Install the built package
```
flatpak-builder --user --install --force-clean build-dir com.tracktion.Waveform12.yml
```

Run the app
```
flatpak run -u com.tracktion.Waveform12 
```


Flathub
-------

Flathub is the central place for building and hosting Flatpak builds.
Go to https://flathub.org/builds/ to see Flathub in action.

Building applications
---------------------

Application manifests should go in their own repository in the [Flathub](https://github.com/flathub) organization,
named after the application ID.

For example, for gnome-recipes, there is a repository named org.gnome.Recipes which has the org.gnome.Recipes.json
file at the toplevel.

Hosted builds should be stable releases, not development snapshots, so please use tarballs or git tags, not just
the tip of a branch.

More detailed requirements can be found in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/flathub/flathub/wiki/Review-Guidelines)

Using the Flathub repository
----------------------------

To install applications that are hosted on Flathub, use the following:
```
flatpak remote-add flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Recipes
```
